Test cases
This folder contains a number of .txt files that have a series
of test edge cases that my code should run. All tests must be passed
as an indicator that I have tried to handle all possible scenarios.

One of the files is a .py which uses the UNITTEST method (Python Library)
to run a series of tests.
It follows the class structure and all test functions should start
with test_.
